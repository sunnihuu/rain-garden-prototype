The parent material consists of coarse-loamy over sandy lodgment till derived from gneiss, granite, and/or schist. Depth to a root restrictive layer, densic material, is 20 to 39 inches. The natural drainage class is well drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is low.  Available water to a depth of 60 inches (or restricted depth) is moderate.  Shrink-swell potential is low. This soil is not flooded. It is not ponded. A seasonal zone of water saturation is at 30 inches during January, February, March, April, November, December. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 6 percent.  Nonirrigated land capability classification is 3e.  This soil does not meet hydric criteria.   "|"13882001"|"12878521"
