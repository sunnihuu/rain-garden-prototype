  Description:
    Abstract:
      This data set is a digital soil survey and generally is the most
      detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the National
      Cooperative Soil Survey. The information was prepared by digitizing
      maps, by compiling information onto a planimetric correct base
      and digitizing, or by revising digitized maps using remotely
      sensed and other information.

      This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and
      computerized attribute data. The map data are in a soil survey area
      extent format and include a detailed, field verified inventory
      of soils and miscellaneous areas that normally occur in a repeatable
      pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at
      the scale mapped. A special soil features layer (point and line
      features) is optional. This layer displays the location of features
      too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large
      enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and
      management. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the
      National Soil Information System relational database, which gives
      the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties.

      The soil map unit delineation boundaries are subject to a cartographic standard of
      19 ground meters of separation. Compared to previous nonproject (non-SSURGO-
      certified) mapping that was conducted at 1:4,800 in Gateway National Recreation
      Area, the 1:12,000 scale mapping will appear to have less detail. However, the
      1:12,000 SSURGO product represents the largest-scale official soils data published
      by the USDA-NRCS, and supersedes nonproject mapping at larger scales that appears
      to provide greater detail. In the process of correlating the mapping to a smaller
      scale, individual map unit delineations were combined (into complexes) and some
      features, especially wetter areas, small water bodies, or very narrow features
      (e.g. short steep slopes or escarpments), may be represented by special features
      (in the "*_p" and "*_l" feature classes). For more information regarding nonproject
      surveys in New York City, please visit: http://www.nycswcd.net/soil_survey.cfm
    Purpose:
      SSURGO depicts information about the kinds and distribution of
      soils on the landscape. The soil map and data used in the SSURGO
      product were prepared by soil scientists as part of the National
      Cooperative Soil Survey.
    Supplemental_Information:
      Digital versions of hydrography, cultural features, and other
      associated layers that are not part of the SSURGO data set may be
      available from the primary organization listed in the Point of
      Contact.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      The attribute accuracy is tested by manual
      comparison of the source with hard copy plots and/or symbolized
      display of the map data on an interactive computer graphic system.
      Selected attributes that cannot be visually verified on plots or
      on screen are interactively queried and verified on screen. In
      addition, the attributes are tested against a master set of valid
      attributes. All attribute data conform to the attribute codes in
      the signed classification and correlation document and amendment(s).
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    Certain node/geometry and topology GT- polygon/chain relationships
    are collected or generated to satisfy topological requirements
    (the GT-polygon corresponds to the soil delineation). Some of these
    requirements include: chains must begin and end at nodes, chains
    must connect to each other at nodes, chains do not extend through
    nodes, left and right GT-polygons are defined for each chain
    element and are consistent throughout, and the chains representing
    the limits of the file are free of gaps. The tests of logical
    consistency are performed using vendor software. All internal
    polygons are tested for closure with vendor software and are checked
    on hard copy plots. All data are checked for common soil lines (i.e.,
    adjacent polygons with the same label). Edge locations generally do
    not deviate from centerline to centerline by more than 0.01 inch.

    The Soil Survey of (NY081) Queens County, New York is edge matched
    to all of the adjacent SSURGO certified soil surveys:
    NJ025 - Monmouth County, New Jersey
    NY005 - Bronx County, New York
    NY047 - Kings County, New York
    NY059 - Nassau County, New York
    NY061 - New York County, New York
    NY085 - Richmond County, New York

    The soil survey boundary for Queens County matches the soil survey
    boundary for all of the adjacent certified soil surveys.

    The Soil Survey of Queens County is bordered on the north by the East River; to the
    east by Nassau County, New York; to the south by the Atlantic Ocean and to the west
    by the East River, Kings County, New York, and the Atlantic Ocean. Some feature edges
    in this soil survey are not matched to those in the Soil Survey of Nassau County, New
    York. Acceptable joins as outlined in the National Soil Survey Handbook (available
    online), accessed 04/26/12, were achieved with the Soil Survey of Nassau County, New
    York. Differences across county lines occurred relative to map unit design used in
    mapping. One major difference between the New York City survey and join surveys is
    use of anthropogenic soils. Joining surveys used map unit complexes of Urban land and
    soil series, however those soil components represent natural soil series and similar
    soils. The New York City soil survey represents the first comprehensive urban soil
    survey that recognizes and correlates disturbed soils to the series taxonomic level
    and employs them as components in map units. Often times the Urban land component
    matches across the survey boundary and the non-matching components are natural and
    anthropogenic series. An exception is made for adjoining organic soils, which are
    considered to match. Overlapping slope ranges are considered as matching. Exact joins
    as outlined in the National Soil Survey Handbook (available online), accessed 3/6/14,
    were achieved with the Soils Surveys for Bronx County, New York, Kings County, New
    York, and New York County, New York.  Completeness_Report:
    A map unit is a collection of areas defined and named in terms of
    their soil components or miscellaneous areas or both. Each map
    unit differs in some respect from all others in a survey area and
    each map unit has a symbol that uniquely identifies the map unit
    on a soil map. Each individual area, point, or line so identified
    on the map is a delineation.
  Completeness_Report:
    Soil Scientists identify small areas of soils or miscellaneous areas
    that have properties and behavior significantly different than the
    named soils in the surrounding map unit. These minor components
    may be indicated as special features. If they have a minimal effect
    on use and management, or could not be precisely located, they may
    not be indicated on the map.

    A map unit has specified kinds of soils or miscellaneous areas
    (map unit components), each with a designated range in
    proportionate extent. Map units include one or more kinds of soil
    or miscellaneous area. Miscellaneous areas are areas that have little
    or no recognizable soil.

    Specific National Cooperative Soil Survey standards and procedures
    were used in the classification of soils, design and name of map
    units, and location of special soil features. These standards are
    outlined in Agricultural Handbook 18, Soil Survey Manual, 1993,
    USDA, NRCS; Agricultural Handbook 436, Soil Taxonomy, 1995,
    USDA, NRCS; and all Amendments; Keys to Soil Taxonomy,
    (current issue) USDA, NRCS; National Soil Survey
    Handbook, title 430-VI,(current issue) USDA, NRCS.

    The actual composition and interpretive purity of the map unit
    delineations were based on data collected by scientists during
    the course of preparing the soil maps. Adherence to National
    Cooperative Soil Survey standards and procedures is based on
    peer review, quality control, and quality assurance. Quality
    control is outlined in the memorandum of understanding for the
    soil survey area and in documents that reside with the Natural
    Resources Conservation Service state soil scientist. Four kinds
    of map units are used in soil surveys: consociations, complexes,
    associations, and undifferentiated groups.

    Consociations - Consociations are named for the dominant soil.
    In a consociation, delineated areas use a single name from the
    dominant component in the map unit. Dissimilar components are
    minor in extent. The soil component in a consociation may be
    identified at any taxonomic level. Soil series is the lowest
    taxonomic level. A consociation that is named as a miscellaneous
    area is dominantly that kind of area and minor components do not
    significantly affect the use of the map unit. The total amount of
    dissimilar inclusions of other components in a map unit generally
    does not exceed about 15 percent if limiting and 25 percent if
    nonlimiting. A single component of a dissimilar limiting inclusion
    generally does not exceed 10 percent if very contrasting.

    Complexes and associations - Complexes and associations consist
    of two or more  dissimilar components that occur in a regularly
    repeating pattern. The total amount of other dissimilar components
    is minor extent. The following arbitrary rule determines whether
    complex or association is used in the name. The major components
    of an association can be separated at the scale of mapping. In
    either case, because the major components are sufficiently different
    in morphology or behavior, the map unit cannot be called a
    consociation. In each delineation of a complex or an association,
    each major component is normally present though their proportions
    may vary appreciably from one delineation to another. The total
    amount of inclusions in a map unit that are dissimilar to any of
    the major components does not exceed 15 percent if limiting and
    25 percent if nonlimiting. A single kind of dissimilar limiting
    inclusion usually does not exceed 10 percent.

    Undifferentiated groups - Undifferentiated groups consist of two
    or more components that are not consistently associated
    geographically and, therefore, do not always occur together in
    the same map delineation. These components are included in the
    same named map unit because their use and management are the same
    or very similar for common uses. Generally they are grouped together
    because some common feature, such as steepness, stoniness, or
    flooding, determines their use and management. If two or more
    additional map units would serve no useful purpose, they may be
    included in the same unit. Each delineation has at least one of the
    major components, and some may have all of them. The same principles
    regarding the proportion of minor components that apply to
    consociations also apply to undifferentiated groups. The same
    principles regarding proportion of inclusion apply to
    undifferentiated groups as to consociations.

    This soil survey is a subset of Major Land Resource Area (MLRA) 149B.  Profile
    Descriptions and transects from the entire MLRA, supplement documentation from
    Within the subset.

    Minimum documentation consists of three complete soil profile
    descriptions that are collected for each soil added to the legend,
    one additional per 3,000 acres mapped; three 10 observation
    transects for each map unit, one additional 10 point transect per
    3,000 acres.

    A defined standard or level of confidence in the interpretive
    purity of the map unit delineations is attained by adjusting the
    kind and intensity of field investigations. Field investigations
    and data collection are carried out in sufficient detail to name
    map units and to identify accurately and consistently areas of
    about 1.5 acres.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        The accuracy of these digital data is based upon their
        compilation to base maps that meet National Map
        Accuracy Standards at a scale of 1 inch equals 1,000
        feet. The difference in positional accuracy between the
        soil boundaries and special soil features locations in the
        field and their digitized map locations is unknown. The
        locational accuracy of soil delineations on the ground varies
        with the transition between map units.

        For example, on long gently sloping landscapes the transition
        occurs gradually over many feet. Where landscapes change
        abruptly from steep to level, the transition will be very
        narrow. Soil delineation boundaries and special soil features
        generally were digitized within 0.01 inch of their locations on
        the digitizing source. The digital map elements are edge matched
        between data sets. The data along each quadrangle edge are
        matched against the data for the adjacent quadrangle. Edge
        locations generally do not deviate from centerline to centerline
        by more than 0.01 inch.

        No soil survey data is available for Queens County, New York.  The
        boundary of the Queens County Soil Survey has been digitized by the
        U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Natural Resources Conservation
        Service (NRCS) Michigan Digitizing Unit (MIDU) staff.  The MIDU staff
        created a geodatabase for the 'NOTCOM' surveys in New York with the
        ARCGIS Version 9.3 software. The boundary for each 'NOTCOM' survey was
        digitized 'on-screen' from the County Mosaic of the USGS Topographic
        Quadrangles Digital Raster Graphic (DRG) image files.  The adjacent
        soil surveys were downloaded from the Soil Data Warehouse (SDW) and
        imported into the geodatabase.  The boundaries of this soil survey
        were adjusted to match the boundaries of the adjacent soil surveys
        at a tolerance of 0.1 meters.  The 'NOTCOM' soil area for NY081
        was exported from the ARCGIS software as an ARC interchange file.

        checked the data with a set of ARC Macro Language (AML) programs
        developed by the USDA-NRCS National Cartographic and Geospatial
        Center (NCGC).  The coverage was checked using the July 2009 SSURGO
        Evaluation AML programs.  The New York soil scientists supplied
        the SSURGO download from NASIS.  The map unit key is added to the
        coverage to link the 'NOTCOM' area in the spatial data to the NASIS
        database.  Upon successful completion of the SSURGO Evaluation, the
        county coverages and the metadata were electronically transferred to
        the NRCS Staging Server to be joined with the tabular data.

        transformation from NAD83 to WGS84 using the NAD_1983_To_WGS_1984_1 datum
        transformation method was applied to the data.  The data were checked with
        the SSURGO Evaluation scripts provided by U.S. Department of Agriculture,
        Natural Resources Conservation Service. The shapefiles were then uploaded
        to the soil data warehouse for archival and distribution.

      Process_Description:
        Soil delineations were manually digitized using ArcMap,
        version 10.1. Digitizing, quality control, and quality assurance were performed
        by soil scientists and cartographic technicians at the Natural Resources
        Conservation Service. New York City had a previous nonproject soil survey,
        published 2005, at a scale of 1:62,500. The map units from this Reconnaissance
        Soil Survey were used as a reference with regard to parent material. There was
        also a prior non-project soil survey made at a larger scale for Gateway National
        Recreation Area. Soil map unit delineations from the USDA-NRCS Gateway National
        Recreation Area non-project soil survey were generalized from the 1:4,800 scale
        to the 1:12,000 SSURGO scale through heads-up digitizing. To ensure accuracy at
        publication scale, digital soil delineations were visually verified at a scale of
        1:12,000 with reference to digital ancillary layers including orthoimagery; ten
        meter resolution hillshade and slope models developed from the ten meter NED;
        three meter resolution hillshade, wetness index, and slope models developed from
        2 foot DOITT contour data; hydrography; existing wetland inventory; historical
        surficial geology; historic fill; bedrock geology; land cover; and elevation
        contours. Easily identified features were utilized to ensure vertical integration
        and accurate soil delineation placement.

        Field procedures for the second order soil survey included
        plotting of soil boundaries determined by field observation, by interpretation of
        remotely sensed data, and recorrelation of existing non-project soil surveys
        within the area. Boundaries were verified at closely spaced intervals, and the
        soils in each delineation were identified by traversing and transecting the
        landscape. Urban land composition of map units was determined through an ArcGIS
        zonal statistics analysis of the National Land Cover Dataset Impervious Surface
        raster. The classification and map unit names were progressively reviewed between
        November 2007 and April 2012. Digitizing, quality control, and quality assurance
        were conducted by soil scientists at the 12-TOL MLRA Soil Survey Office, New York
        Natural Resources Conservation Service, and Soil Survey Region 12 Office.

        The Natural Resources Conservation Service State Soil Scientist or
        delegate verified that the labels on the digitized soil map units
        link to map units in the tabular database, and certified the joined
        data sets for release to the Soil Data Warehouse. A system assigned
        version number and date stamp were added and the data were copied to
        the data warehouse. The tabular data for the map units and components
        were extracted from the data warehouse and reformatted into the soil
        data delivery data model, then stored in the Soil Data Mart. The spatial
        data were copied to the Soil Data Mart without change.

    Attribute:
      Attribute_Label: Special Soil Features Codes
      Attribute_Definition:
        Special Soil Features labels represent specific Special Soil
        Features. These features are identified with a descriptive
        label. The label is assigned to the point or line assigned
        to represent the feature on maps.

  Overview_Description:
    Entity_and_Attribute_Overview:
      Map Unit Delineations are closed polygons that may be dominated
      by a single soil or miscellaneous area component plus allowable
      similar or dissimilar soils, or they can be geographic mixtures
      of groups of soils or soils and miscellaneous areas.

      The map unit symbol uniquely identifies each closed map unit
      delineation. Each symbol corresponds to a map unit name. The
      map unit key is used to link to information in the National
      Soil Information System tables.

      Map Unit Delineations are described by the National Soil
      Information System database. This attribute database gives the
      proportionate extent of the component soils and the properties for
      each soil. The database contains both estimated and measured data
      on the physical and chemical soil properties and soil
      interpretations for engineering, water management, recreation,
      agronomic, woodland, range, and wildlife uses of the soil.

      The National Soil Information System database contains static
      metadata. It documents the data structure and includes such
      information as what tables, columns, indexes, and relationships
      are defined as well as a variety of attributes of each of these
      database objects. Attributes include table and column
      descriptions and detailed domain information.

      The National Soil Information System database also contains a
      distribution metadata. It records the criteria used for selecting
      map units and components for inclusion in the set of distributed
      data.

      Special features are described in the feature table.  It includes an
      area symbol, feature label, feature name, and feature description for
      each special and ad hoc feature in the survey area.
