"NY081"|3|"CLA"|"Clay spot"|A spot where the surface texture is silty clay or clay in areas where the surface layer is sandy loam, loam, silt, or coarser. Typically 0.5 to 1.4 acres.|"199782"
"NY081"|3|"GUL"|"Gully"|A very small channel with steep sides cut by running water and through which water ordinarily runs only after a rain or an ice or snow melt. Generally is an obstacle to wheeled vehicles and is too deep to be obliterated by ordinary tillage.|"199783"
"NY081"|3|"MAR"|"Marsh or swamp"|A water saturated, very poorly drained area, intermittently or permanently water-covered.  Marsh areas are dominantly covered by sedges, cattails, and rushes.  Swamps are dominantly covered by trees or shrubs.  Not used in map units where poorly drained or very poorly drained soils are the named components.  Typically 0.5 to 1.4 acres.|"199784"
"NY081"|3|"SAN"|"Sandy spot"|Surface layer with sand content greater than 75 percent in areas where the surface layer of the named soils of the surrounding map unit have lass then aobut 25 percint sand.    Typically 0.5 to 1.4 acres.|"199785"
"NY081"|3|"SLP"|"Short, steep slope"|Narrow soil area that has slopes that are at least two slope classes steeper than the slope class of the surrounding map unit.|"199786"
"NY081"|3|"SPO"|"Spoil area"|Piles of earthy materials either smoothed or uneven resulting from human activity.  Typically 0.5 to 1.4 acres.|"199787"
"NY081"|3|"STV"|"Very Stony spot"|A spot where 0.1 to 3 percent of the surface cover is rock fragments that are greater than 10 inches in diamater where the surrounding soil has less than 0.01 percent of the surface cover of stones. Typically 0.5 to 1.4 acres.|"199788"
"NY081"|3|"WAT"|"Perennial water"|Small, natural or constructed lake, pond, or pit that contains water most of the year. Typically 0.5 to 1.4 acres. |"199789"
"NY081"|3|"WET"|"Wet spot"|A somewhat poorly drained to very poorly drained area that is at least two drainage classes wetter than the named soils in the surrounding map unit.  Typically Typically 0.5 to 1.4 acres.|"199790"
"NY081"|3|"ESA"|"Anthropogenic escarpment"|A relatively continuous and steep slope or cliff, which is constructed by humans, that breaks the continuity of more gently sloping land surfaces.  Exposed material is nonsoil, for example rubble or blasted bedrock, or steep soil banks.Typically 0.5 to 1.4 acres.|"199791"
"NY081"|3|"HAL"|"Haline spot"|An area where the surface layer has an electrical conductivity of 8 mmhos cm-1 more than surface layer of the named soils in the surrounding map unit, which has an EC of 2 mmhos cm-1 or less.  The higher EC is caused from tidal saltwaters as opposed to evaporative salts.Typically 0.5 to 1.4 acres.|"199792"
"NY081"|3|"COA"|"Coal ash dump"|An area of accumulated coal combustion by-products primarily sourced from past coal burning furnaces.  These deposits can be at or above the neighboring ground level and are often concealed beneath a mantle of fill and vegetative cover. Typically 0.5 to 1.4 acres. |"199793"
"NY081"|3|"RBV"|"Very rubbly spot"|A spot where greather than 15 percent of the surface cover are fragments that are greater than 10 inches in diameter where the surrounding soil has less than 3 percent of the surface cover of stones. It generally is an obstacle to wheeled or tracked vehicles. Typically 0.5 to 1.4 acres.|"199794"
"NY081"|3|"ATV"|"Very artifactual spot"|A spot where 0.1 to 3 percent of the surface cover is artifacts that are greater than 10 inches in diameter where the surrounding soil has less than 0.01 percent of the surface cover of artifacts. Typically 0.5 to 1.4 acres.|"199795"
